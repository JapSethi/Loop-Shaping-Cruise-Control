# Cruise-Control-Loop-Shaping

**To shape the closed loop transfer function for a Cruise Control system** 

#### Objectives Achieved: 
- Analyzed the benefits of feedback for a cruise control system with uncertain dynamics and disturbances.
- Designed Proportion-Integral Feedback controller to reduce the steady-state tracking error to zero.
- Shaping the loop transfer function to have desirable sensitivity and complementary sensitivity.
