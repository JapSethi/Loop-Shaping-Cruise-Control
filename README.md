# <div align="center">Cruise-Control-Loop-Shaping</div>

**<div align="center">To shape the closed loop transfer function for a Cruise Control system and analyze the benefits of the feedback system.</div>** 

#### Objectives Achieved: 
- Analyzed the benefits of feedback for a cruise control system with uncertain dynamics and disturbances.
- Designed Proportion-Integral Feedback controller to reduce the steady-state tracking error to zero.
- Shaping the loop transfer function to have desirable sensitivity and complementary sensitivity.
